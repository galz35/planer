        // I'll try to use the debug-task script's approach of DB access to check DTO? No DTO is runtime check.

        // Better idea: Modify the backend code to LOG the validation error in GlobalExceptionFilter or ValidationPipe (but those are libs).
        // Or I can temporary modify the controller to console.log the body before validation... wait, validation happens BEFORE controller.
